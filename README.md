# RolledOutReplaySaver
I'm lazy, so reap the benefits of my efficient laziness!

This tool won't last very long. I plan on making this solely because replays dont' automatically save yet in-game.

Simply install this to your Rolled Out! Replays folder

`C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\RolledOut\Saved\Replays\auto`

And run the script to have access to the buttons.

Ctrl+S will save replays while on any menus. **(YOU MUST EXIT BEFORE RESPAWNING FOR THE REPLAY TO SAVE.)**
Ctrl+Q will quit the program.
