# RolledOut Replay Saver
I'm lazy, so reap the benefits of my efficient laziness!

This tool won't last very long. I plan on making this solely because replays don't automatically save yet in-game.

Simply drag this to your Rolled Out! Replays folder:

`C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\RolledOut\Saved\Replays\auto`

And run the script to have access to the buttons.

Ctrl+S will save replays while on any menus. **(YOU MUST EXIT BEFORE RESPAWNING FOR THE REPLAY TO SAVE.)**
Ctrl+Q will quit the program.

Exiting and re-opening the program within the same minute and saving results in overwriting an old replay. It's an oversight on my end that I don't feel like fixing since this tool will hopefully be obsolete relatively soon.
